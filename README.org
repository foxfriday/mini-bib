* mini-bib.el

This package provides minimal citation management tools. The only advantage over other
similar packages is that it's small and easy to auditâ€”though it depends on [[https://github.com/joostkremers/parsebib][parsebib]].
Fortunately the library is well documented and easy to understand. The package provides
three functions which make use Emacs completions mechanism:

~mini-bib-note~: open or creates a note associated with the entry.
~mini-bib-cite~: insert a citation.
~mini-bib-open~: opens the file associated with the entry.
